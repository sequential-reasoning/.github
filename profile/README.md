  Sequential reasoning, often known as linear reasoning, is a cognitive process characterized by 
  a logical progression of thoughts or actions in a consecutive and orderly manner. It involves 
  connecting ideas or steps in a straightforward chain, where each subsequent element builds upon 
  the preceding one. This type of reasoning follows a clear and predictable path, making it an 
  effective approach for tasks that require structured problem-solving, task execution, or decision-
  making by considering the direct sequence of events or concepts.
